# linkedin-clone
I created a clone of LinkedIn with authentication functionality and database for storing user's data (like their posts). I have used redux and firebase to create this project. It is hosted on firebase itself.
I did not try to replicate LinkedIn entirely but implemented some basic functions like user login and logout. User's ability to post and read other users' post in the feed section.
All the posts and users' information is stored on firestore.
